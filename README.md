# CAJITA CALIENTE

## DESCRIPTION

Cajita Caliente is an app that allows users to upload files into a virtual file system. Ordinary users can only read/download a file where as Owners can do anything to the files they own. In addition to keeping track of the file structure, this app also associates meta-data with each file, including items like:
    * date when the file was either created or uploaded
    * date it was modified
    * tags

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

The technologies used for this project on the backend include such technologies as :Node modules, Express, Mongo DB. A complete is included in the Api README. On the frontend, the App uses Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Gitflow, and Flexbox. To help stay on top of tasks and responsibilities, the team used Trello Board

## APPROACH TO DEVELOPING THE APP

Upon receiving the specification from the client, the development team sat down to review the list of requirements for the app and developed a plan of action which included:

* assigning team roles/responsibilities
* developed working agreements/guidelines for the team that included items such as:
    * pair program throughout the project (exceptions where necessary)
    * push/stretch ourselves by working in areas where we feel our skills could improve
    * members will take on specific roles, however, all will get chance via rotation
    * need two reviews for git commits
* created planning documents that included wireframes, ERD, and user stories
* developing schedule for production
* decided on tools to use to monitor progress (Trello)

## USER STORIES

  * As a user, I would like to be able to sign up/in/out and change my password
  * As a user, I'd like to know if there is an error upon sign up or in
  * As a user, I like to upload files
  * As a user, I'd like to download files
  * As a user, I'd like edit the tags on my files
  * As a user, I'd like to delete files

## UNRESOLVED ISSUES
With more time, the team would like to improve UX/UI. The biggest hurdle was time (wish we had more). A hurdle that we had to overcome towards the end was encountering some conflicts with git merges. Some of the changes that were made did come through after rebasing. We backtracked and were able recover.
